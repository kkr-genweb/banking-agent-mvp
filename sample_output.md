1. Basic Balance Inquiry:
Response: Your recent transaction history indicates no anomalies, and both transactions appear valid. The counterparty associated with the transaction to 'DEUTDEFF' (Deutsche Bank AG) has been verified and poses a low risk. You may proceed with confidence regarding your account status.
Risk Score: 2/10
Compliance Notes: Recent transactions compliant and verified with low risk counterparty.

2. SWIFT Transaction Validation:
Response: Your transaction for $15,000 to DEUTDEFF has been validated and approved. The counterparty is verified with a low risk level. However, note that the transaction amount is significantly higher than your typical transaction amount of $500. Please ensure that you have documented the purpose of this payment as a business transaction.
Approve Transaction: True
Risk Score: 5/10
Recommended Actions: ['Verify the purpose of the payment for business documentation.', 'Consider scheduling a follow-up review of your payment patterns.']

3. Suspicious Transaction Detection:
Response: Given the significant amount of $50,000, the unverified status of the counterparty (UNKNOWN1), and the elevated risk score associated with this transaction, I highly advise against proceeding with it at this time without further verification. It poses a high risk for potential fraud or mishandling.
Block Card: False
Risk Score: 10/10
Compliance Notes: Transaction to an unverified counterparty with a high risk level, action needed for compliance verification.

4. Transaction Error Detection:
Response: John, the payment of $10,000 for coffee raises significant concerns, given that it is 20 times your typical transaction amount. The description of the transaction does not align with the amount, as it suggests a small purchase. Additionally, the counterparty's identity is not found in the verified database, indicating a high risk. It is essential to verify the transaction details and the recipient before proceeding.
Risk Score: 8/10
Recommended Actions: ['Verify the intention behind the high transaction amount.', 'Confirm recipient details before making the payment.', 'Consider adjusting the transaction amount to align with your typical spending.']
